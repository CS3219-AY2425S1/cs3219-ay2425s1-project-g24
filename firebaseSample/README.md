This is the Firebase Golang code. It's meant for the backend people to use this code to jumpstart their own REST API development

## Getting Started

First, run the development server by running `main.exe`

Open [http://localhost:8080/question](http://localhost:8080/question) with your browser to see the result.

Remember to place the `cs3219-g24-firebase-adminsdk-9cm7h-b1675603ab.json` file in the same directory/folder as `main.exe`

DO NOT UPLOAD THE `cs3219-g24-firebase-adminsdk-9cm7h-b1675603ab.json` FILE ONTO GITHUB, OR ELSE THE FIREBASE CODE WILL STOP WORKING!!!
